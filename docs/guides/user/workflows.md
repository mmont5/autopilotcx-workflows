# Patient Journey Symphony Workflow (User Guide)

## What is the Patient Journey Symphony?
The Patient Journey Symphony is an automated workflow that guides patients through every step of their experience at your medical practice. It uses advanced AI agents (with musical-themed names) to make onboarding, billing, telehealth, and communication seamless and delightful for both patients and staff.

## How Does It Work?

**Step 1: OvertureAgent (Greeter & Triage)**
- You are first greeted by our OvertureAgent, who asks how they can help you and finds out your needs (e.g., appointment, billing, medical question, new/existing patient, etc.).
- Based on your response, you are routed to the right next step.

**Step 2: Specialized Agents**
- If you are a new patient, you are guided through onboarding by PreludeAgent.
- If you have a billing question, ScoreAgent helps you.
- If you need a telehealth appointment, VirtuAgent takes over.
- For other needs, you may be routed to a summary or support agent.

**Step 3: Communication & Summary**
- At the end, ComposerAgent provides clear, friendly updates and a summary of your journey.
