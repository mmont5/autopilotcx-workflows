## Critical Issues & Development Status

### CRITICAL ISSUE #1: LLM Integration Broken
**Status:** 🔴 **CRITICAL - BLOCKING DEMO**

**Problem:** LLMs are not being used as primary responders in the workflow. The system is defaulting to templates instead of intelligent LLM responses.

**Impact:** This breaks the core philosophy of the platform and prevents demos from working properly.

**Required Fix:**
1. **Fix workflow routing** - Ensure proper intent classification
2. **Integrate knowledge base** - LLMs pull from client data
3. **Add conversation state** - Maintain booking flow context
4. **Enable LLMs as primary** - With templates as fallback

### CRITICAL ISSUE #2: Dr. Hassan Demo Not Working
**Status:** 🔴 **CRITICAL - BLOCKING FIRST CLIENT**

**Problem:** After 10+ months of development, cannot get ONE DEMO working for the FIRST PROSPECTIVE CLIENT.

**Impact:** This represents a critical failure that prevents platform launch and revenue generation.

**Required Fix:**
1. **Fix conversation state management** - Maintain booking flow context
2. **Implement proper intent classification** - Route to correct workflow branches
3. **Integrate knowledge base** - Use Dr. Hassan's data for responses
4. **Enable natural conversation** - No scripts, authentic interactions
