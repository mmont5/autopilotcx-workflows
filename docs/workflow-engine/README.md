## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL 12+
- Redis 6+
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up environment variables
3. Run the setup script:
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

### Quick Start
1. Start the services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
2. Run migrations:
```bash
./scripts/migrate.sh
```
3. Access the API documentation at `/api/docs`

## Architecture

### Components
- **API Layer**: FastAPI-based REST API
- **Core Services**: Workflow engine, state machine, monitoring
- **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL for persistence, Redis for caching
- **Security**: JWT authentication, role-based access control

## Core Concepts

### Workflow
A workflow is a sequence of steps that define an automated process. Each workflow has:
- Unique identifier
- Name and description
- Version information
- Step definitions
- Input/output schemas

### Workflow Execution
A workflow execution represents a single run of a workflow:
- Execution status tracking
- Input/output data
- Error handling
- State transitions
- Performance metrics

### State Machine
The state machine manages workflow execution states:
- State definitions
- Valid transitions
- State history
- Context management
- Transition validation

## API Reference

### Authentication
- JWT-based authentication
- Bearer token in Authorization header
- Token refresh mechanism
- Role-based access control

### Endpoints
- `/api/v1/auth`: Authentication endpoints
- `/api/v1/workflows`: Workflow management
- `/api/v1/executions`: Workflow execution
- `/api/v1/monitoring`: Execution monitoring
- `/api/v1/errors`: Error handling
- `/api/v1/testing`: Testing framework

## Workflow Management

### Creating Workflows
```python
{
    "name": "Example Workflow",
    "description": "A sample workflow",
    "steps": [
        {
            "name": "Step 1",
            "type": "action",
            "config": {...}
        }
    ]
}
```

### Workflow Versioning
- Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Version history tracking
- Backward compatibility checks
- Migration support

## Workflow Execution

### Execution States
- INITIALIZED
- RUNNING
- WAITING
- COMPLETED
- FAILED
- CANCELLED
- PAUSED
- RESUMED

### Execution Flow
1. Workflow initialization
2. State machine setup
3. Step execution
4. State transitions
5. Error handling
6. Completion/cancellation

## State Machine

### States
```python
class WorkflowState(Enum):
    INITIALIZED = "initialized"
    RUNNING = "running"
    WAITING = "waiting"
    COMPLETED = "completed"
    FAILED = "failed"
    CANCELLED = "cancelled"
    PAUSED = "paused"
    RESUMED = "resumed"
```

### Transitions
- State transition validation
- Transition conditions
- Transition actions
- State history tracking

## Monitoring & Error Handling

### Monitoring
- Real-time execution tracking
- Performance metrics
- System-wide monitoring
- Metrics collection
- Data retention policies

### Error Handling
- Error tracking
- Error patterns
- Recovery mechanisms
- Error cleanup
- Error reporting

## Testing

### Test Types
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- End-to-end tests
- Performance tests
- Load tests

### Test Framework
- Test suite management
- Test case execution
- Result tracking
- Test data cleanup
- Timeout handling

## Best Practices

### Workflow Design
1. Keep workflows modular
2. Use clear naming conventions
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Add comprehensive documentation
5. Include test cases

### Performance
1. Optimize step execution
2. Use caching effectively
3. Monitor resource usage
4. Implement cleanup routines
5. Handle timeouts properly

### Security
1. Validate all inputs
2. Implement proper authentication
3. Use role-based access control
4. Secure sensitive data
5. Monitor security events
