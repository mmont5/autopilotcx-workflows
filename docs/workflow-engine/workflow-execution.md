# Workflow Execution Guide

## Overview
This document provides detailed information about workflow execution in the AutopilotCX Workflow Engine, including execution states, transitions, and best practices.

## Execution States

### State Definitions
The workflow engine uses a state machine to manage execution states:

```python
class WorkflowState(Enum):
    INITIALIZED = "initialized"  # Initial state when execution is created
    RUNNING = "running"         # Workflow is actively executing
    WAITING = "waiting"         # Waiting for external input or condition
    COMPLETED = "completed"     # Execution completed successfully
    FAILED = "failed"          # Execution failed with error
    CANCELLED = "cancelled"     # Execution was cancelled
    PAUSED = "paused"          # Execution is temporarily paused
    RESUMED = "resumed"        # Execution resumed from pause
```

### State Transitions
Valid state transitions are defined in the state machine:

1. INITIALIZED → RUNNING
   - Occurs when execution starts
   - Validates workflow and input data
   - Sets up execution context

2. RUNNING → WAITING
   - Occurs when step requires input
   - Stores execution context
   - Waits for external input

3. WAITING → RUNNING
   - Occurs when input is received
   - Validates input data
   - Continues execution

4. RUNNING → COMPLETED
   - Occurs when all steps complete
   - Validates final output
   - Cleans up resources

5. RUNNING → FAILED
   - Occurs on error
   - Captures error details
   - Logs failure information

6. RUNNING → CANCELLED
   - Occurs on user cancellation
   - Stops execution
   - Cleans up resources

7. RUNNING → PAUSED
   - Occurs on pause request
   - Stores execution state
   - Waits for resume

8. PAUSED → RESUMED
   - Occurs on resume request
   - Restores execution state
   - Continues execution

## Execution Process

### 1. Initialization
```python
execution = WorkflowExecution(
    workflow_id=workflow_id,
    input_data=input_data,
    status=ExecutionStatus.PENDING
)
```

### 2. State Machine Setup
```python
state_machine = WorkflowStateMachine()
state_machine.setup_transitions()
state_machine.update_context({
    "workflow_id": workflow_id,
    "execution_id": execution.id,
    "input_data": input_data
})
```

### 3. Step Execution
```python
for step in workflow.steps:
    try:
        result = await execute_step(step, context)
        state_machine.update_context({
            "current_step": step.name,
            "step_result": result
        })
    except Exception as e:
        state_machine.transition_to(WorkflowState.FAILED)
        raise
```

### 4. Error Handling
```python
try:
    await execute_workflow(workflow_id, input_data)
except WorkflowError as e:
    await handle_workflow_error(e)
except Exception as e:
    await handle_unexpected_error(e)
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Execution Metrics
- Start time
- End time
- Duration
- Step execution times
- Resource usage
- Error counts

### Real-time Monitoring
```python
await monitor.track_execution(
    execution_id=execution.id,
    status=execution.status,
    metrics={
        "duration": duration,
        "steps_completed": steps_completed,
        "error_count": error_count
    }
)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Error Handling
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Use appropriate error types
- Log detailed error information
- Implement retry mechanisms
- Clean up resources on failure

### 2. State Management
- Validate state transitions
- Maintain state history
- Handle edge cases
- Implement timeout mechanisms
- Clean up stale states

### 3. Resource Management
- Monitor resource usage
- Implement cleanup routines
- Handle concurrent executions
- Manage database connections
- Cache frequently used data

### 4. Performance
- Optimize step execution
- Use async operations
- Implement caching
- Monitor execution times
- Handle timeouts

## API Usage

### Starting Execution
```python
POST /api/v1/executions
{
    "workflow_id": "workflow-123",
    "input_data": {
        "key": "value"
    }
}
```

### Monitoring Execution
```python
GET /api/v1/executions/{execution_id}
```

### Cancelling Execution
```python
POST /api/v1/executions/{execution_id}/cancel
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. Execution stuck in WAITING state
   - Check input requirements
   - Verify external dependencies
   - Review timeout settings

2. Execution fails repeatedly
   - Check error logs
   - Verify input data
   - Review step configurations
   - Check resource limits

3. Performance issues
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Check database performance
   - Review caching strategy
   - Optimize step execution

### Debugging
1. Enable debug logging
2. Review execution history
3. Check state transitions
4. Monitor resource usage
5. Review error patterns

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- Validate all input data
- Sanitize user input
- Check data types
- Verify data ranges
- Handle malformed data

### Access Control
- Implement authentication
- Use role-based access
- Validate permissions
- Log access attempts
- Monitor security events

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Secure data transmission
- Implement data retention
- Handle data cleanup
- Monitor data access
