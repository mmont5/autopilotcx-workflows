# jsPDF Library Typing Task

## Overview
The current implementation of the PDF export functionality in the Analytics Dashboard has type errors related to the jsPDF library. This task aims to properly type the library to resolve these issues.

## Current Issues
1. `doc.text()` method type errors
2. `autoTable` integration type errors
3. Missing type definitions for jsPDF extensions

## Required Changes
1. Create proper type definitions for jsPDF with autoTable
2. Update the PDF generation code to use proper types
3. Add type checking for PDF content generation

## Implementation Steps
1. Create a new type definition file `src/types/jspdf.d.ts`
2. Define proper interfaces for jsPDF with autoTable
3. Update the PDF generation code to use these types
4. Add proper error handling for type mismatches
5. Test the implementation with various data types

## Dependencies
- jsPDF
- jspdf-autotable
- TypeScript

## Acceptance Criteria
- All type errors are resolved
- PDF generation works as expected
- Type safety is maintained throughout the PDF generation process
- No runtime errors related to type mismatches

## Priority
Medium - While the functionality works, proper typing will improve maintainability and developer experience.

## Estimated Effort
2-3 hours

## Notes
- Consider creating a wrapper around jsPDF to provide better type safety
- Document the type definitions for future reference
- Consider adding unit tests for type checking
