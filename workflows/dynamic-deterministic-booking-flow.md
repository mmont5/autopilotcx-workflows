# Dynamic Deterministic Booking Flow - Multi-Tenant & Human

## **Core Principles Maintained**

âœ… **Human, Caring, Varied Responses** - Multiple response templates per state
âœ… **Fully Dynamic** - No hardcoded business/company/location data
âœ… **Multi-Tenant** - Works for any industry, category, business size
âœ… **Full Context Preservation** - Demo data + chat interactions merged
âœ… **Modular Architecture** - Industry workflows + category modules

## **Updated Deterministic Booking Agent**

```javascript
// DYNAMIC DETERMINISTIC BOOKING AGENT - Multi-Tenant & Human
// Maintains human variations, fully dynamic, preserves context
