# BookingAgent Node - DETERMINISTIC FIX

## Node to Replace: BookingAgent
**Current Issue:** This node is using LLM calls which cause slow responses and button bleed. We're replacing it with a deterministic state machine.

## Instructions:
1. In your N8N workflow, find the **BookingAgent** node (Code node)
2. Replace the entire JavaScript code in that node with the code below
3. Save the workflow
4. Test the booking flow

## New Code for BookingAgent Node:

```javascript
// DETERMINISTIC BOOKING AGENT - No LLMs, Fast & Reliable
// This replaces the LLM-based approach with a deterministic state machine

console.log("ðŸš€ DETERMINISTIC BOOKING: Processing state:", $json.bookingState);

const agentName = $json.agentName || "Olivia";
const companyName = $json.companyName || "Hassan Spine & Sports Medicine";
let bookingState = $json.bookingState || "initial";
const parsedBookingData = $json.bookingData ? JSON.parse($json.bookingData) : {};
const userInput = $json.message || $json.user_message || "";
const userAction = $json.userAction || "";

console.log("ðŸš€ DETERMINISTIC BOOKING - Input:", userInput);
console.log("ðŸš€ DETERMINISTIC BOOKING - Action:", userAction);
console.log("ðŸš€ DETERMINISTIC BOOKING - Current State:", bookingState);

// STATE MACHINE LOGIC
let response = "";
let suggestedActions = [];
let nextState = bookingState;
let updatedBookingData = { ...parsedBookingData };

// RESPONSE VARIATIONS FOR HUMAN-LIKE INTERACTIONS

## What This Fix Does:

1. **ELIMINATES LLM CALLS** - No more slow responses
2. **FIXES BUTTON BLEED** - Explicitly manages `suggestedActions` array
3. **DETERMINISTIC STATE MACHINE** - Predictable, fast responses
4. **HUMAN-LIKE VARIATIONS** - 3 variations for each response type
5. **COMPLETE BOOKING FLOW** - All 15 steps from Dr. Hassan's requirements
6. **DYNAMIC DATA** - Uses company name and agent name from context

## Next Steps:
1. Copy this code into your **BookingAgent** node in N8N
2. Save the workflow
3. Test the booking flow
4. Export the updated JSON
5. I'll then examine the exported JSON and provide the next node fix

This should immediately fix your slow response and button bleed issues!
