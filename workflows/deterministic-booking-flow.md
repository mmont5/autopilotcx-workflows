# Deterministic Booking Flow - No LLMs

## **Overview**
This replaces the LLM-driven booking flow with a simple, reliable state machine that handles all booking steps deterministically.

## **Booking States**
1. `initial` - Welcome message with New Patient/Existing Patient buttons
2. `patient_type_selected` - User selected patient type, ask for name
3. `collecting_name` - Collecting First Name and Last Name
4. `collecting_dob` - Collecting Date of Birth
5. `collecting_phone` - Collecting Phone Number
6. `collecting_email` - Collecting Email Address
7. `collecting_location` - Selecting location (Old Bridge, Jersey City, South Plainfield)
8. `collecting_pain_level` - Pain level 1-10
9. `collecting_symptoms` - Free text symptoms
10. `collecting_procedure` - Selecting procedure/treatment
11. `collecting_insurance` - Insurance provider selection
12. `collecting_insurance_details` - Additional insurance verification
13. `collecting_additional_info` - Any additional information
14. `confirmation` - Confirm all collected information
15. `complete` - Booking completed

## **Code for "Deterministic Booking Agent" Node**

Replace the "Build Booking Prompt" node with this:

```javascript
// DETERMINISTIC BOOKING AGENT - No LLMs
// Simple state machine for reliable booking flow

console.log("ðŸš€ DETERMINISTIC BOOKING: Processing state:", $json.bookingState);

const agentName = $json.agentName || "Olivia";

let bookingState = $json.bookingState || "initial";
const parsedBookingData = $json.bookingData ? JSON.parse($json.bookingData) : {};
const userInput = $json.message || $json.user_message || "";
const userAction = $json.userAction || "";

console.log("ðŸš€ DETERMINISTIC BOOKING - Input:", userInput);
console.log("ðŸš€ DETERMINISTIC BOOKING - Action:", userAction);

## **Update Intent Classifier**

The Intent Classifier should route to this new deterministic flow:

```javascript
// In Intent Classifier, when intent === "appointment"
if (detectedIntent === "appointment") {
  nextAgent = "DeterministicBookingAgent"; // New agent name
}
```

## **Benefits of This Approach**

âœ… **No LLM Latency** - Instant responses
âœ… **Predictable State Transitions** - No confusion about next steps
âœ… **Easy Testing** - Each state can be tested independently
âœ… **Reliable Button Management** - Buttons only appear when needed
âœ… **Fast Debugging** - Clear state flow and data collection
âœ… **Consistent Experience** - Same flow every time

## **Next Steps**

1. Replace the "Build Booking Prompt" node with this deterministic flow
2. Update the Intent Classifier to route to "DeterministicBookingAgent"
3. Test each state transition
4. Add any missing procedures or insurance options
5. Deploy and test with real users

This will give you a rock-solid booking flow that works every time!
